- concat_rtl.vhdl: Convolution + ReLU RTL generated by Catapult

- top_vivado.vhdl: file used with the project "ZyboVGARAMProc" to generate
bitstreams and run FPGA tests (the "real" top module was the design wrapper
used in "ZyboVGARAMProc").

- Bitstreams: Convolution+ReLU layer tests using identity, edge detection and sharpen kernels.
