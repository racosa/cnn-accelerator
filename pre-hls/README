# Pre-hls CNN code

- ./vanilla: C++ floating point implementation

- ./fixed-point: C++ fixed point implementation using the library ac_fixed

- ./db: database folder containing input data files used by both vanilla and
fixed point implementation. Three files are already present in the
folder and others can be download from a Dropbox folder:

 -- ./db/100-normalized-images.out: a subset of 100 images of the cifar10
 test_batch normalized with a python script

 -- ./db/100-normalized-images-fixW8I2.out: the same subset of the file
 above limited between -2 and 1.984375.

 -- ./db/100-labels.out: cifar-10 labels corresponding to the file above

 -- The other normalized images and labels used to
 test the CNN can be downloaded running the script ./db/download-data-c
 or downloading them directly from this Dropbox folder: http://goo.gl/annxGb
